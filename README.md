## About me

I am an enthusiastic Computer Science and Engineering professional with unique attributes. Drawing from my background in computer science, I bring a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and a passion for innovation. On the other hand, my engineering mindset instils a structured approach to projects, attention to detail, and an unwavering commitment to optimizing systems for efficiency and performance. These dual facets of my skill set enable me to approach complex challenges with a well-organized and analytical mindset, ensuring precision and creativity in my work.

I got my Bachelor of Technology Undergraduate Degree from the GIET University Gunupur ODISHA and have been a Software Engineer for 2 years in TechMahindra.In my role as  an Automation Tester, I thrive on the intersection of technology and quality assurance. With a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of testing methodologies, I leverage automation tools and frameworks to ensure software products meet the highest standards of functionality and reliability. I'm dedicated to creating efficient and robust test scripts that not only save time but also enhance the overall software development process. My commitment to continuous improvement allows me to adapt to ever-evolving software landscapes and deliver rigorous testing solutions that contribute to the delivery of high-quality, error-free applications.
